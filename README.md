# Pollution Control - Afforestation Suitability Analysis

This Python project analyzes air quality and identifies potential areas for afforestation using simulated spatial data.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how environmental data (like AQI) can be analyzed to guide afforestation efforts in polluted regions.

## Features

- Simulated AQI data using `pandas` and `geopandas`
- Land use classification with random sampling
- Weighted suitability scoring based on land type and AQI proximity
- Visualization of afforestation suitability using `matplotlib`

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- GeoPandas
- Matplotlib
- Shapely

## How to Run

1. Ensure the required libraries are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy geopandas matplotlib shapely
   ```

2. Run the script in any Python IDE or using the terminal:
   ```bash
   python Pollution\ Control\ PYTHON\ PROJECT.py
   ```

3. The output will display a heatmap of afforestation suitability across a geographic grid.

## Use Cases

- Urban planning and green zone development
- Environmental research and education
- Prototyping spatial analysis methods for pollution control
